# third.site

**A Third Place interface.**  
Static-first. Protocol-aligned. No noise.

---

## What this is

`third.site` is a **public interface surface** for things that already exist.

Not a product.  
Not a platform.  
Not a feed.

It is a place where **finalized signals** can appear without distortion.

If something is here, it has already passed:
- presence
- coherence
- continuity

Nothing speculative lives on this domain.

---

## What this is not

- Not a roadmap  
- Not a marketing site  
- Not a social network  
- Not a dashboard  
- Not a blog  
- Not an explanation layer  

If you are looking for:
- vision decks
- promises
- timelines
- features  

You are in the wrong place.

---

## Core principles

- **Static by default**  
  No dynamic behavior unless explicitly justified.

- **Finality over iteration**  
  Content appears when it is ready. Not before.

- **No upstream mutation**  
  This interface does not edit, interpret, or evolve source truth.

- **No identity capture**  
  No profiles. No tracking. No personalization.

- **Clarity over engagement**  
  The system does not optimize for clicks or time-on-page.

---

## Relationship to the ecosystem

- `third.site` is an **interface**, not a system.
- It reflects outcomes from upstream systems (events, ledgers, protocols).
- It never becomes the source of truth.

Upstream systems remain:
- private where required
- public where mandated
- always traceable

This site only **references**. It never rewrites.

---

## Technical posture

- Static HTML  
- CDN-delivered  
- Git-backed  
- Deterministic deploys  
- No server-side logic  

If the page changes, it is because a **commit** happened — not because something drifted.

---

## Governance

Silence is allowed.  
Empty pages are allowed.  
Waiting is allowed.

Updates happen only after explicit commit.

---

## License

Content and protocols referenced here may be CC0 or otherwise specified upstream.  
This interface itself makes no ownership claims.

---

If you’re here early:  
good. That’s intentional.
